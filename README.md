# Industrial-Fire-Safety-System-Project

Aim:
 
The Industrial Fire Safety System Project is a comprehensive solution designed to enhance the safety and security of workers in industries. With the integration of various sensors and the utilization of an Arduino Uno microcontroller, this system provides real-time monitoring and early detection of environmental conditions that could lead to fire hazards. The system incorporates a DHT11 Temperature Sensor, MQ2 Gas Sensor, MQ136 Gas Sensor, Flame Sensor, LED indicators, a Buzzer, and an LCD display to create a multifaceted approach to industrial fire safety.
 
Results:
 
The System was tested using TinkerCad software. The system was proved to be working and generated visual and auditory alarms in case of fire. The Industrial Fire Safety System Project represents a significant step forward in addressing the critical issue of fire safety in industrial environments. By integrating a range of sensors, an Arduino Uno microcontroller, and alert mechanisms, this project offers a comprehensive solution for real-time monitoring, early detection, and prompt response to potential fire hazards.
